        The Swamp House is a giant tree that contains two rooms. Upon entrance, there's the main room, which functions as both a kitchen and dining room. 
        There is also a bed for Ogre children. And the west of the main room is master bedroom. 
        Although Rumpelstiltskian in design, this tree hosue has been updated. 
        There is furniture in the house instead of just an being empty tree stump with no doors or windows carved into it and it is really dry around.
        Outside, he has an ogre mud bath where he can relax and play with the family.

        The swamp has an outhouse. A path leads to Shrek's Garden, where he likes to grow weeds. 
        A mud water slide for children can be found in the garden along with other ameninities like a mud shower, and a large courtyard-like area where the fairy tale creatures were arrested by Lord Farquat. 
        After he gets married at the end, his wife moves in and then later their three children are born and live there as well. In the alternate reality, it is an empty tree stump with no doors or windows carved into it and the trees have rotted away and weeds cover the courtyard and Shrek's Garden is gone. Shrek originally did not own the swamp, as it was part of the lordship of Duloc. 
        The ruler, Lord Farquaad, used the swamp as a dumping ground for the Fairy Tale creatures after he forced them to leave their homes in Duloc, disturbing Shrek's solitary existence. This becomes Shrek's main motivation to rescue Fiona so Farquaad would give him the deed. 
        Becoming the rightful owner of the swamp would give him the legal rights to force the Fairy Tale creatures to move on. However, after rescuing Fiona and falling in love with her, Shrek has a change of heart. As agreed, Farquaad gives him title to the swamp, but when he returns to his home he finds it is lonely without Fiona. Later, when Shrek marries Fiona, he allows the Fairy Tale creatures to reside with him in the swamp, but retains legal ownership of the land.
